# Configuration

**Nikolai\_** has made a [mod recommendation](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1cQ4y1w7vG/) on Bilibili, which introduces how to configure the gamebox.

## Subscribe HTML Loader

This gamebox uses **HTML Loader** to load local `html`, `CSS`, and `js` files. Please go to [Workshop Page](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2998621113) to subscribe to this addon. If you want to know how it works, you can go to its [Github page](https://github.com/Periapsises/gm\_html\_loader), this addon is open source.

3，Wait for the beta to finish downloading.

## Download CEF

CEFCodecFix automatically patches Gmod's internal Chromium Embedded Framework, so you can run more advanced games after installing it.

1. Go to GModCEFCodecFix [release page](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModCEFCodecFix/releases/tag/20230929) on Github to download the latest version. ![img](https://s2.loli.net/2024/01/26/jXcsw1pt6IZxVGh.png)
2. You will get a file named `GModCEFCodecFix-Windows.exe`, run it. ![img](https://s2.loli.net/2024/01/26/3P4nKVfQOm8MAvp.png)
3. When this prompt appears, the installation of the CEF is complete. ![img](https://s2.loli.net/2024/01/26/XiDQxOYzZqcWVA1.png)

In this step, please note:

1. If you can't install it due to network problems, you can search for GModCEFCodecFix installation tutorials online. Alternatively, you can try searching for tutorials on how to use **Play X**, as **Play X** also requires CEFCodecFix.
2. If you still can't start the game after installation, the installation may be interrupted, please open `GModCEFCodecFix-Windows.exe` to continue to repair. Please **close** Gmod and try several times!
