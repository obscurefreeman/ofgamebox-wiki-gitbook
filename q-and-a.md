## About Gamebox

**Q: The mouse doesn't work well in some 3D games.**

A: This gamebox contains some 3D FPS games. While playing these games, you may encounter situations where it is difficult to adjust the camera with the mouse. Note that some of these games offer some alternative control methods, such as Half-Life where you can use ←→ and PgUp and PgDn to turn heads, while in Poom you can use the ←→ key to achieve similar functions.

## About Screen

**Q: Will my friend in multiplayer be able to see the screen while I play it?**

A: Unfortunately, they can't see it.

**Q: The resolution on the screen is not fitting.**

A: This screen only supports playing at 1920\*1080 resolution, because the principle of this addon is to project the player's panel onto the model. If you use other resolutions, there will be issues with screen and model alignment.
